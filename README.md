This repo is part of the research done with Physics ETH department regarding reinforcement learning for autonmous vechicles. 

## Description

We propose deep reinforcement learning methods that are able to navigate in complex unknown environments attaining a performance close to human-level intelligence.

Traditionally, mobile robots have been controlled by operators to reach regions where
human access is restricted due to capacity constraints or security reasons. However, recent
interest in space exploration has revealed the limitations of such technology and the
urgency of having autonomous navigation systems. Self-driving vehicles require simultaneous
localization and mapping (SLAM), and robust path planning. To perform those
tasks, tedious calculations are needed as well as sophisticated algorithms.
The purpose of this thesis is to analyze recent advancements in deep reinforcement learning
and propose methods that are able to navigate in complex unknown environments.

To achieve this, we embed procedures mimicking well-known mechanisms and statistical
techniques using neural networks. Our novel model integrates auxiliary tasks in the loss
function and borrows elements from the external external memory (Graves et al., 2016)
which act as internal representation of the map. The experimental results show that the
proposed approach attains a performance close to human-level intelligence.
